**Description of Data:** <br/>
[Crime Rating](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data): With this dataset we hope to look at the number of crimes in each neighborhood and rank them from lowest crime rate to highest crime rate. <br/>
[Education Quality](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods-with-snap-data): This dataset contains data on what percent of students achieve various degrees (e.g. high school diploma) so we attempt to rate school districts <br/>
[Local Income](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data): This dataset contains Aggregate Household Income per Neighborhood, as well as Total Population per neighborhood. This submtric will be determined by the ratio of Aggregate Household Income/ Total Population. <br/>
<br/>
In this project we will set out to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on a metric we describe as best overall living conditions. This metric will be formed by a combination of three submetrics: lowest crime rate, best average income per person, and best education. By finding the neighborhood that ranks highest in these categories we will be able to tell which is the best to live in.
