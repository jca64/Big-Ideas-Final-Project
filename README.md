In this project we will set out to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on a metric we describe as best overall living conditions. This metric will be formed by a combination of three submetrics: lowest crime rate, lowest income tax, and best education. By finding the neighborhood that ranks highest in these categories we will be able to tell which is the best to live in.
