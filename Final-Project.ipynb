We started by creating our metric \"Overall Quality of Life\" which is formed by our three submetrics. These submetrics are crime rate, education quality, and local income. By scoring each of the neighborhoods in these categories and finding which neighborhood has the best score overall, we will decide which is the best to live in!"
